[Ivan's Octopress theme](https://github.com/ivanjovanovic/ji-octopress-theme) is really very nice.

Quite a  while ago, I used  to enjoy far blander  themes, and the  high-key/black on white
theme that  became very  popular with Google's  main webpage  was a big  hit with  me well
before Google's time. In fact, that was my  webpage theme for a long time. It was actually
inspired by [someone at MIT](http://www.mit.edu/people/tivol/).

Anyway, I  think a change  now and then  is good for you.  Ivan's theme strikes  the right
balance between the bland/big lettered web sstyles of today and a genuine appreciation for
color and font rendition on modern machines.
