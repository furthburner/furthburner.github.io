I          found           that          the          basic           [Epson V700 scanner](http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/jsp/Product.do?sku=B11B178011)   works  quite
well    with    the   OEM    software    that   came    with    it.     I   tried    using
[VueScan](http://www.hamrick.com), and wanted to like it, but I must say the program is a
little counterintuitive--maybe the fact that the  trial version of VueScan on Windows and
(Ubuntu) Linux differ by quite a bit seems to  have played a role in this decision.  I liked that
VueScan works  in Linux,  and I might  gravitate towards  it for that  reason at  a later
time. For now, it appears like I am happy with a workflow that involves my Epson V700 OEM
software and Windows XP.

On a related note,  what about the iScan software and related  drivers from the Epson site
(see  [this thread  on  the askubuntu.com  forum](http://askubuntu.com/questions/190820/12-04-epson-scanner-will-not-install)?  I still  have not tried this software  on the Ubuntu
box. I'll post my results here soon after I try it.
