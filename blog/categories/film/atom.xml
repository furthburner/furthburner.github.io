    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I          found           that          the          basic           <a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/jsp/Product.do?sku=B11B178011">Epson          V700  scanner</a>   works  quite
well    with    the   OEM    software    that   came    with    it.     I   tried    using
<a href="http://www.hamrick.com">VueScan</a>, and wanted to like it, but I must say the program is a
little counterintuitive&mdash;maybe the fact that the  trial version of VueScan on Windows and
(Ubuntu) Linux differ by quite a bit seems to  have played a role in this decision.  I liked that
VueScan works  in Linux,  and I might  gravitate towards  it for that  reason at  a later
time. For now, it appears like I am happy with a workflow that involves my Epson V700 OEM
software and Windows XP.</p>

<p>On a related note,  what about the iScan software and related  drivers from the Epson site
(see  <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/190820/12-04-epson-scanner-will-not-install">this thread  on  the askubuntu.com  forum</a>?  I still  have not tried this software  on the Ubuntu
box. I&rsquo;ll post my results here soon after I try it.</p>
