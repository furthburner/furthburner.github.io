    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I met this Chet Kanojia  a few years ago at a technology meet in  Boston. He was already a
bit of a celebrity then, in a room full  of TV execs and advertisement execs. Chet has the
raw energy  of a man on  a mission. I  wish Aereo and  Chet speedy and awesome  success in
their endeavors. Life&rsquo;s too short for annoying monopolies and cartels.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, you  want to enjoy  TV programming minus  the trouble and  the expenses of  paying for
cable TV. If you live in the USA, you are in luck—my short note below will help you choose
and install a simple antenna system that will get the TV signals to your TV. Hope you have
a HDTV—these instructions will only work for HDTVs.</p>

<p>The very first  step is to check if  your address has decent TV reception.  The website <a
title="AntennaWeb                 website"                href="http://www.antennaweb.org"
target="_blank"><a href="http://www.antennaweb.org">http://www.antennaweb.org</a></a> will let  you check if you can  get any Over
The Air (OTA) reception for any of the  channels at your address. Hopefully, you get a few
channels, and you can actually rid your home  of a cable subscription. The next step is to
get an antenna. There are a large number of HDTV antennas out there, but I currently use a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mohu-Leaf-Paper-Thin-Indoor-Antenna/dp/B004QK7HI8">Mohu Leaf antenna</a>, which
is   quite  discreet.   Until recently, I used  an  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Antennas-Direct-DB2-Directional-Antenna/dp/B000EHUE7I/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1328403643&amp;amp;sr=1-2">Antennas Direct DB2</a>, which  was
 far bulkier, uglier  but about as good. Depending  on where you
live,      you      may      need      a      signal     booster—I      use      a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Antennas-Direct-DB2-Directional-Antenna/dp/B000EHUE7I/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;amp;ie%0A=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1328403643&amp;amp;sr=1-2">Motorola bi-directional RF amplifier</a>, but I have also used a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000F28DP2/ref=pe_385040_30332190_TE_M3T1_ST1_dp_1">PCT 1-port bi-directional cable TV/HDTV amplifier signal booster with passive return path</a>
 and works just as well.</p>

<p>Install the antenna and RF amplifier close to the TV. My antenna is right beside my HDTV—I
didn&rsquo;t bother  hanging the antenna outside  and running coax  all the way to  my TV—though
with the Antennas Direct DB2 antenna model, though I could have. However, if I did that, I
will probably have  had to amplify the signal  a couple of times before it  reaches the TV
(one signal booster per 75 feet of coax is a rule I read somewhere on the Internet).</p>

<p>The next step is to tune your TV to receive the channels your antenna is pushing. Many TVs
have   an   autotune   feature   for   antennas.   On  my   Panasonic   TV,   you   choose
Menu-&gt;setup-&gt;auto tune, and bingo, the TV  automatically tunes itself for all the TV
programming it is picking up via the antenna.</p>

<p>Thats' it! You are done! No more pesky monthly cable bills for your TV, and no more yearly
arbitrary bill increases.</p>

<p>When you enjoy your TV programming via the antenna, be prepared to experience minor signal
disruptions every once a while, but mainly when the weather goes bad. Where I live, in New
England, I find the  signal disruption happens when it rains, and  when it snows, but also
sometimes when the weather  is perfect. On the whole, I don&rsquo;t  experience it very often at
all—say a handful of  times in a year. When the disruptions do occur,  get a sense of what
signal strength  the TV is experiencing—this  information has a direct  correlation to the
quality of the signal, and the disruptions you see (on my Panasonic TV, this is an item on
the  sub-menu). Most  often, minor,  5-10 degree  change in  antenna direction  solves the
problem for me.. Considering  the fact that my setup is in the  basement with no access to
the exterior around, this is remarkable.</p>

<p>I bought my OTA HD antenna goodies from  Amazon a few years ago when the analog TV signals
were beginning to be phased out (2008).  At that time, the total cost of my antenna+signal
booster for OTA HDTV were about $80 US. Since then, I&rsquo;ve upgraded to the Mohu leaf antenna
which is extremely discreet  but just as good as my previous  antenna (my wife argues that
it is better). The total cost of TV  programming for our household over the past 6 years =
USD 120  (two antennas including  the recent upgrade,  and a signal booster).  Total saved
(assuming USD  10 per  month for  basic cable): USD  12 x  10 x  6 &ndash; USD  120 =  USD 600).
Everyone knows that cable companies charge more for basic channels, though.</p>

    <id>http://furthburner.github.io/blog/2014/01/16/want-a-landline-phone-set-up-a-completely-free-landline-service-for-us-and-canada</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here in the North  America, it must truly be one of the  most crazy market observations of
the day that there are people who actually pay for their non-mobile telephone service, the
kind of service that until just a few years ago, used to be called a “landline.”</p>

<p>The landline lives among us. It lurks in all manner of deals, triple-plays, dual-plays and
quad-plays; disguised  as a service you need  to pay for. “$20  unlimited US/Canada!” “$20
Unlimited world” (by  “world,” they only mean “US/Canada and  three other countries). All
manner of other bizarre promotions exist.</p>

<p>But my question is—if you live in the US and Canada—why on earth would you want to pay for
telephone service in an era when Google  Voice exists, and there are a zillion ATA devices
out there? I enjoyed  free phone calling goodness for all 2011  through 2013, and in 2014,
it appears like  Google has every intention  of keeping Google voice payment  free for USA
and Canada calls.</p>

<p>In the “good-old days” age of telephony, PSTN-based telephone companies were all the rage,
and they needed physical telephone wires to be laid all the way into your home. This means
that the  cost of  the telephone service  was to p  ay for  the labor, maintenance  of the
cabling  to  your home  and  your  neighbors' and  the  infrastructure  that  needs to  be
maintained at the core. The great side effect of the Internet-based transport of telephony
data (or VoIP)  is th at the rapidly expanding  infrastructure for Internet communications
laid by  the same  companies that  are selling you  “landline” plans  can also  carry your
telephony data. Psst: here&rsquo;s  a dirty secret: that is precisely what  these co mpanies are
doing when you pay them for a “landline—“  you are not exactly using a telephone wire very
much any more.</p>

<p>My question is: why are you letting them do that?</p>

<p>I have  been using free phone  service via Google  Voice and my regular,  “landline” phone
devices (Uniden phones or even an old fashioned  corded one!) for nearly a year now, and I
was a late entrant  to this party! It is possible through the magic  of an ATA device like
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/OBi110-Service-Bridge-Telephone-Adapter/dp/B0045RMEPI">ObiHai   110</a>
and a  Google Voice account,  which is free,  and already available to  you if you  have a
Google mail account on gmail (that is, no  additional crap to sign up for and maintain the
password). I spent a  total of $50 USD circa spring of 2011 on  the ObiHai 110 device, and
powered it  up and connected  it to via Ethernet  to m y  router in the basement.   I also
connected a  “landline” cordless phone&rsquo;s base  to the phone  (RJ11) port on my  ObiHai 110
using a telephone  jack. I then <a href="http://obihai.com/googlevoice.html">configured the  ObiHai 110 device to use  my Google Voice
account  details</a>. Lo and  behold! I  now have  a dial
tone on  my landline device,  and you  can use your  cordless phone to  make/receive phone
calls in the USA and Canada.</p>

<p>Yes, it is really that simple!</p>

<p>Do it!</p>

<p>PS: There&rsquo;s  just one caveat to  all of this&mdash;you cannot  make 911 calls with  the setup I
describe above. Rather,  for making 911 calls, you have to  register with an old-fashioned
phone company  and pay only  for their 911  service (don &rsquo;t you  just hate that!).  Read a
<a href="http://michigantelephone.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/review-of-the-obihai-obi110-voip-device-part-3-911-on-the-cheap/">crisper         introduction         to         some        hacks         on         this
front</a>.</p>
